\section{Proposed wording}

In section \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.cond]/4}, edit as follows:

\vspace{2em}

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{3em}
\noindent The predicate of a contract condition has the same semantic restrictions as if
it appeared as the first expression-statement in the body of the function it
applies to. \remove{Additional access restrictions apply to names appearing in a
contract condition of a member function of class C:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5em]

\item[--] \remove{Friendship is not considered.}

\item[--] \remove{For a contract condition of a public member function, no member
of C or of an enclosing class of C is
accessible unless it is a public member of C, or a member of a base
class accessible as a public member
of C (10.8.2).}

\item[--] \remove{For a contract condition of a protected member function, no member
of C or of an enclosing class of C
is accessible unless it is a public or protected member of C, or a
member of a base class accessible as a
public or protected member of C.}

\end{itemize}

\hspace{-2.1em}\noindent\remove{For names appearing in a contract condition of a non-member function,
friendship is not considered. \emph{[Example:}
}

\hspace{-2em}\remove{\ldots}

\hspace{-2.1em}\remove{\emph{end example]}
}
